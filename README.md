## Overview
This project is about parallel computing using `MPICH` which is formerly known as MPICH2 and it's a freely available, portable implementation of MPI, a standard for message-passing for distributed-memory applications.

The code is written in `C`.
The implemented parallel computings are handled with 3 machines.
